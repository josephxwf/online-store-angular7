   3. change the execution right of index.html to executable and change the base tag to point to the directory you want it to be the root of your website.


## Issues
   1. Caches issue solved after using post method instead of get method
   2. URL routing issue solved by adding { useHash: true } in app-routing.noudle.ts:

   @NgModule({
     imports: [ RouterModule.forRoot(routes, { useHash: true }) ], // "useHash: true" solves URL routing issue on http serve
     exports: [ RouterModule ]
   })
